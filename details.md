**Split!** enables teams to easily continue unfinished work items into the next sprint by “splitting” the work item into a new card in the next sprint. 

## What's special about Split?
* Smart detects incomplete tasks
* Defaults split work item to the next iteration
* Maintains parent link
* Retains all attachments
* Inserts revisions of split for auditability 

## How does it work? 
Use the context menu of a work item from the board or backlog to split a work item with unfinished work into the next sprint.

![Invoke Split from work item context menu](/img/split-contextmenu.png "Context Menu")

The dialog automatically populates with the remaining incomplete items. Review and remove any items that no longer meet the requirements, and click "Split."

![Select the remaining work items tobe split](/img/split-dialog.png "Dialog")

The new split work item is created in the next sprint with the remaining work items.
